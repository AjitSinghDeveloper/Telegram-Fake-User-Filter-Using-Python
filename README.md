# Why Filter Out Fake Users?
Fake users, bots, and inactive accounts can negatively impact your Telegram community and the quality of your interactions. Some of the main reasons to filter them out include:

Improved Engagement: Removing fake users ensures that your messages reach real people, leading to more genuine interactions.
Accurate Analytics: Fake accounts can distort your group/channel statistics, leading to misleading conclusions about your audience.
Increased Trustworthiness: A user base filled with real people builds a more trusted community, which is especially important for businesses or influencers.
# How Does This Software Work?
This software is designed to automatically scan your Telegram data and identify users that are likely to be fake. The detection process relies on a set of criteria that are typically associated with fake accounts, such as:

Username Patterns: Many fake accounts use randomly generated usernames or follow unusual naming patterns.
Account Inactivity: Accounts with very little activity or no profile information are often fake or abandoned.
Bot-like Behavior: Users that behave like bots (e.g., joining too many groups or channels in a short span of time) are flagged for removal.
Once detected, these users can either be flagged for review or automatically removed from your dataset, allowing you to keep your Telegram group/channel clean and authentic.

# Key Features
Automated Fake User Detection: Quickly scans large datasets and flags users with suspicious characteristics.
Customizable Rules: You can customize the detection criteria based on your specific needs, adjusting the sensitivity to better identify fake accounts.
Batch Processing: Efficiently processes large numbers of users, making it ideal for groups or channels with thousands of members.
Manual Review Option: Provides the option to manually review flagged accounts before removing them to ensure no false positives.
Practical Use Cases
This software is perfect for anyone managing a Telegram group or channel who wants to improve the quality of their user base:

# Group Admins:
Keep your group clean from spammers, bots, and fake users.
Influencers: Ensure your follower count reflects real, engaged people, which helps in building credibility.
Business Owners: Improve the effectiveness of your Telegram marketing by targeting real users.
